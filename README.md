This is a complete front-end of a school website which aims to provide all school related information of the parents/guardians on the website.

This design is based on Neubrutalism theme, which is not very common, but it still gives good vibes.

It is developed with React, Typescript, HTML and CSS.

The design was in Figma, with all layouts defined, and I converted the design to front-end in React with perfect results, and added screen
responsiveness for most screen sizes.
